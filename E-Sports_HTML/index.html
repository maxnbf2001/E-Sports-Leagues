- need to make some sort of teamService.js that has functions to access specific information. Consider
- reconfiguring the way the data is set up, similar to the way the data is set up in NFLForecast. Get rid of
- lname, and hardcode list of leagues, then use that name, and cycle through the elements in that leauge. In
- the case of NFL is was the divisons, but for me it will be blue league and gold league.
